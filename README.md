# OOP_Bangladesh_Red_Crescent_Society
A Windows-based software simulation of the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society using JavaFX and Apache NetBeans 17 IDE for the Object-Oriented Programming course, has clinched the 4th position among 67 groups in the techfest at Independent University, Bangladesh!  ! It's been an incredible journey collaborating with my amazing teammates, pooling our skills and dedication into crafting this project. From conceptualization to execution, each step was filled with learning and growth.
